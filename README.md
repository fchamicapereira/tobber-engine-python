# tobber - A torrent grabber engine

Very basic project written in python 2.6 for searching torrents and grabbing the torrent file using my own personal tastes.

<b>Compatible torrent sites</b>
- https://zooqle.com
- https://nyaa.patsu.cat

<b>Tools:</b>
  - [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)

If you can't connect to the websites, change your DNS server.

Run "python igniton.py" to start the program.
